# Google Maps Scraper API

A FastAPI service for scraping Google Maps data based on search queries. Ideal for n8n users.

Very high performance, watch out for rate limiting!

Use variables to replace URL parameters

scrape-get?query=hotels%20in%2098392&max_places=100&lang=en&headless=true"

If using n8n or other automation, use the /scrape-get endpoint for it to return results

simple install, copy files and run docker compose up -d

Intened to be used with this n8n build:

## Recent Updates

### February 2026 - Stability Refactor ✨
- **Major extractor refactoring** for long-term reliability
  - Prioritizes semantic HTML attributes (aria-labels, data-item-id) over fragile CSS classes
  - Significantly more resistant to Google Maps interface updates
- **New field**: `hours` - Extracts business hours by day
- **Improved category filtering** - Removes UI noise from categories
- See [DATA_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md](DATA_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md) for technical details 

## API Endpoints

### POST `/scrape`
Main endpoint for scraping Google Maps data (accepts JSON body)

### GET `/scrape-get`
Alternative GET endpoint with query parameters (recommended for n8n and webhooks)

### GET `/`
Health check endpoint

## API Parameters

All endpoints support the same parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `query` | string | **Yes** | - | Search query (e.g., "hotels in 98392", "restaurants near Times Square") |
| `max_places` | integer | No | `null` | Maximum number of results to return. If not set, returns all found results |
|| `lang` | string | No | `"en"` | Language code for results. Supports: `en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt`, `nl`, `pl`, `sv`, `da`, `no`, `el`, `tr`, and more |
| `headless` | boolean | No | `true` | Run browser in headless mode. Set to `false` for debugging |
| `concurrency` | integer | No | `5` | Number of concurrent browser tabs for scraping (range: 1-20). Higher = faster but more detection risk |

### Parameter Notes
- **query**: URL encode special characters when using GET endpoint
- **max_places**: Useful for limiting API costs and response time. Without this, the scraper will continue until all results are found or the end of the list is reached
- **lang**: Affects both the language of results and consent form detection. Currently supported consent forms: en (English), es (Spanish), de (German), fr (French), it (Italian), nl (Dutch), pt (Portuguese), pl (Polish), sv (Swedish), da (Danish), no (Norwegian), el (Greek), tr (Turkish)
- **headless**: Set to `false` only for local debugging (not recommended in Docker)
- **concurrency**: Default of 5 is balanced. Increase for speed (max 10 recommended) or decrease to 1-2 if experiencing rate limiting

## Running the Service

### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Local Development
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the API:
```bash
uvicorn gmaps_scraper_server.main_api:app --reload
```


The API will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

or for docker:

`http://gmaps_scraper_api_service:8001`

## Response Format

Each place in the results includes:

```json
{
  "name": "Starbucks",
  "place_id": "ChIJ...",
  "coordinates": {
    "latitude": 47.6062,
    "longitude": -122.3321
  },
  "address": "1912 Pike Pl, Seattle, WA 98101",
  "rating": 4.3,
  "reviews_count": 1234,
  "reviews_url": "https://search.google.com/local/reviews?placeid=...",
  "categories": ["Coffee shop", "Cafe"],
  "website": "https://www.starbucks.com",
  "phone": "2066241965",
  "hours": ["Monday, 5 AM to 9 PM", "Tuesday, 5 AM to 9 PM"],
  "thumbnail": "https://...",
  "link": "https://www.google.com/maps/place/..."
}
```

### Field Notes

- **`rating`**: Overall rating (1.0-5.0), extracted using stable accessibility attributes
- **`reviews_count`**: Total number of reviews (numeric count)
- **`hours`**: Business hours by day (e.g., "Monday, 5 AM to 9 PM") - extracted when available
- **`reviews_url`**: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED** - This URL format no longer works and returns 404 errors as of 2026
- **Individual review extraction**: ⚠️ **Not supported** - Google requires user authentication to view full review content. The scraper can extract overall ratings and review counts but cannot access individual review text/data

### Extraction Stability (Updated Feb 2026)

The scraper has been refactored to prioritize **stable, semantic selectors** over fragile CSS classes:

- 🟢 **Highly Stable Fields**: Use accessibility attributes (`aria-label`, `data-item-id`) that are unlikely to break
  - Address, phone, website, rating, hours, name, place_id
- 🟡 **Moderately Stable**: Use common text patterns
  - Reviews count, categories
- See [DATA_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md](DATA_EXTRACTION_ANALYSIS.md) for technical details

## Features

- ⚡ **Parallel processing**: Scrapes multiple places concurrently (configurable with `concurrency` parameter)
- 📊 **Comprehensive data**: Name, rating, review count, address, coordinates, phone, website, categories, hours, and more
- 🌍 **Multi-language support**: Works with en, es, fr, de, pt, nl, pl, sv, da, no, el, tr, and more
- 🛡️ **Anti-detection**: Random delays and user agent rotation to avoid rate limiting
- 🔄 **Robust error handling**: Multiple fallback strategies for consent forms and feed detection
- 🎯 **Stability-first extraction**: Prioritizes semantic HTML attributes (aria-labels, data-item-id) over fragile CSS classes for long-term reliability

## Troubleshooting

### "Feed element not found" error
- This usually means Google Maps changed its DOM structure or no results were found
- The scraper now has multiple fallback strategies to handle this
- Try with a different query or language parameter

### Empty results
- Check that your query returns results on Google Maps directly
- Try with `headless=false` to see what the browser is doing
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs gmaps_scraper_api_service`

### Slow performance
- Adjust the `concurrency` parameter (higher = faster but more detection risk)
- Default is 5 concurrent tabs, max recommended is 10
- Random delays are added for anti-detection (1-2 seconds per scroll)

### Language-specific issues
- Consent forms are now supported in: en (English), es (Spanish), de (German), fr (French), it (Italian), nl (Dutch), pt (Portuguese), pl (Polish), sv (Swedish), da (Danish), no (Norwegian), el (Greek), tr (Turkish). Use the `lang` parameter to match your target region.
- Example: `lang=es` for Spanish results

## Notes
- For production use, consider adding authentication
- The scraping process may take several seconds to minutes depending on the number of results
- Recommended rate limiting: Max 500 places/day per IP, min 60s between API calls
- Use the `concurrency` parameter to tune performance vs. detection risk (default: 5)

## Known Limitations

- **Review extraction not supported**: Google Maps requires user authentication (login) to view full review content. As of 2026, individual reviews cannot be scraped without violating Google's Terms of Service. The scraper can still extract:
  - Overall rating (e.g., 4.3 stars)
  - Total review count (e.g., 1,234 reviews)
  - Place metadata (name, address, phone, website, etc.)
- **Reviews URL deprecated**: The `reviews_url` field returns a URL that no longer works (404 error) as of 2026
- For alternatives, consider using Google's official Places API for review access (requires API key and has usage costs)
